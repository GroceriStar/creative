screens
1. Welcome – One of my primary goals in designing the quiz was keeping each screen or prompt as succinct as possible. Similar to the sources of inspiration, having one task or focus on each individual screen makes the process seem more enjoyable and fast paced. By asking the user for their name, it also creates an individualized and personal experience, something that I found created a positive impression.

2. Goal & Lifestyle – Both screens follow a grid format in the bottom two thirds of the screen to increase reachability. By having text and graphic indicators, each option is clearly communicated to users to make the experience as intuitive as possible.

3. Restrictions & Preferences – Both screens follow the format of clickable tags as well as manual input. I felt like it may increase efficiency by including common items that they may be allergic to or not prefer in the case that they could easily select these pre-made options. On the other hand, if there were unique items not provided, they could input their own and have it become a selected tag. I want the user to be able to customize the fields unique to them while also trying to condense the process.
